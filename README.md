### Data Processing
* The target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
* The variables that are features of the model are the following: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
* The variables EIN and NAME should be removed from the input data.
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluation of the Model
